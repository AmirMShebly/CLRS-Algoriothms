# CLRS Algorithms in Java and Python

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms from the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein, commonly referred to as CLRS.

The algorithms are implemented in both Java and Python, in order to provide a comprehensive collection for developers comfortable with either language. This repository aims to serve as a helpful resource for those seeking to understand and practice the algorithms discussed in the book.

**Installation and Setup**

To run the Java implementations, ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website.

To run the Python implementations, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official Python website.

To set up the repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    [git clone https://github.com/MahyarFardin/CLRS-book-algorithms-.git](https://github.com/MahyarFardin/CLRS-Algoriothms)

Change to the cloned directory:

    cd CLRS-Algoriothms

Navigate to the specific algorithm directory you wish to run:

    cd <algorithm-directory>

Follow the instructions provided in the specific algorithm directory to run the code.

**Algorithms Covered**

The repository provides implementations of all of the algorithms discussed in the CLRS book. Some of the algorithms included are:

Sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
Graph algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm
Divide and Conquer algorithms: Binary Search, Matrix Multiplication, Closest Pair
